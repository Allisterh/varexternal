Title: Vector autoregression with external instruments
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Martin Baumgaertner
Maintainer: Martin Baumgaertner <martin.baumgaertner1@gmail.com>
Description: This Package estimates a Vector Autoregressive Model with an External Instrument in R. 
    It is based on 
        “Inference in Structural Vector Autoregressions Identified With and External Instrument”, Montiel Olea, Jose L; Stock, James H.; and Watson, Mark W; Working Paper Columbia University.
    The corresponding Matlab code and sample data can be found here: https://github.com/jm4474/SVARIV 
    For now two different Confidence Intervals (CI) for Impulse responses are included: Delta Method, Anderson-Rubin confidence set 
    The confidence interval is robust to the construction of weak-instrument. 
    Note that for strong instrument estimation the CI convergence to standard CI intervals. 
    In addition the authors propose an modified Wald test as a test for weak instruments concerns which is also included in the package. Bootstrap procedures are currently not included.
